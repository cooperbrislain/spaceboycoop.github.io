I've been soldering a bunch of lead wires for RGB LED strips. Usually the lead wires that come attached to the connectors are all cut to the same length, which is fine for attaching them to the ends of LED strips. When making lengths of wire to plug in between strips, however, I found that soldering all the wires in a row presents a few problems. First, you need to use three small tubes of heat-shrink tubing to insulate each of the wires from each other, and then a fourth piece around the whole thing. Additionally, with all the joints at the same point in the harness, that point becomes weaker and more likely to fail. I found that by staggering where I cut the wire, I didn't have to worry about insulating the wires from each other, allowing me to skip the individual insulation and only use one piece of heat-shrink tubing covering all the solder points. Additionally, the other intact wires reinforce the strength of the harness at each solder point. To make sure the wires line up perfectly, I drew lines on a piece of masking tape on my work table that correspond to the length of each wire, cutting each wire so the length compliments that of the wire it is to be joined to. The end result comes out a lot cleaner, stronger, and significantly sped everything up. Furthermore, if you cut all your wires to the same corresponding lengths before brginning soldering, they should only fit together in one order, eliminating the likelihood of accidentally soldering the wrong wires together. This can be especially useful when joining wires whose colors don't match.
