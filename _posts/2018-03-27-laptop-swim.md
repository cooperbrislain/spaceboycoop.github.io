This last year my life has been a practice in transforming struggles into learning opportunities. Last week my Macbook Pro took a swim during a fierce rain storm. This has been a pretty rough year for me and computers. Between system wipes, theft, and accidental damage, I've had to start from scratch countless times, and I've gotten pretty good at it. But while iCloud has been great at restoring my documents in an emergency, it still sets me back a day or two to have to reconfigure my system. There are enterprise solutions out there, but they come at enterprise prices that don't fit my budget, so I set out to create my own solution. 

This time, I've decided to document my whole onboarding process as a series of scripts and configuration files that live in a git repo and my Documents folder, which in turn lives in the iCloud. My hope is that I won't need it to recover from any more catastrophic system failures, but it could come in handy next time I get a shiny new system and need to set it up; perhaps at my next job. At the very least, it could serve useful to someone else and a practice in documenting and establishing a baseline for my environment from which to iterate. 

Without further ado, a link to the repo:
